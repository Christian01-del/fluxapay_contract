//! Gas Estimator — predict Soroban resource costs before submitting transactions.
//!
//! Soroban charges for three resource dimensions:
//!   - **instructions**: CPU compute units consumed by the contract execution.
//!   - **ledger_reads** / **ledger_writes**: number of persistent storage entries touched.
//!   - **events**: number of contract events emitted.
//!
//! The `resource_fee_stroops` field is a conservative estimate derived from the
//! Stellar network's current fee schedule (as of Protocol 21):
//!   - 100 stroops per 10 000 instructions
//!   - 6 250 stroops per ledger read entry
//!   - 10 000 stroops per ledger write entry
//!   - 250 stroops per event
//!
//! All values are static upper-bound estimates based on the known structure of
//! each operation. Actual costs may be lower depending on ledger state (e.g.
//! TTL bumps that are no-ops, cache hits).
