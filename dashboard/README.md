# FluxaPay Merchant Dashboard

A minimal Next.js 14+ (App Router) merchant dashboard for managing FluxaPay payments. It authenticates merchants via SEP-10 wallet connect (Freighter) and reads all data from the indexer API using `@fluxapay/sdk` and `@fluxapay/sdk/react`.

## Features (MVP)

- **Auth** — SEP-10 wallet connect with Freighter, JWT issuance, and JWT-authenticated API calls.
- **Payments list** — table with status and date-range filters, pagination, and search by payment ID.
- **Payment detail** — expandable view with refunds, events timeline, and dispute status.
- **Create payment link** — simple form with QR code display.
- **Analytics** — weekly revenue bar chart from the analytics endpoint.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- `@fluxapay/sdk` and `@fluxapay/sdk/react`
- Tailwind CSS
- Freighter wallet for SEP-10 authentication

No dashboard-specific backend is required — all data comes from the indexer API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- The [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) browser extension

### Install

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
```

### Configure

Create a `.env.local` file in `dashboard/`:

```bash
# Base URL of the FluxaPay indexer API
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUXAPAY_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Stellar network to authenticate against (testnet | mainnet)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
```

### Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and connect your Freighter wallet to sign in.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

```

## Authentication

1. The dashboard requests a SEP-10 challenge from the indexer.
2. Freighter signs the challenge transaction.
3. The signed challenge is exchanged for a JWT.
4. The JWT is attached to all subsequent indexer API calls.

## Responsive Design

The layout is responsive and usable on tablet-sized viewports and larger.

## Linting

CI runs ESLint on the dashboard for every pull request:

```bash
cd dashboard
npm run lint
```
